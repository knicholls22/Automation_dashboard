Tweets/posts need to be filtered in two ways:
- They need to be related to statistics or OSR more generally.
- They need to be filtered by domain (separate issue)

Options:
- Using tags such as @statistics or @osr - easiest option.
- Picking out key words and using those alone (might work if there are no tags)
- Labelling tweets as being related or not - time effort involved but we will capture more of what we want and less of what we don't.
